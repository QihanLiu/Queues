# Queues
This project is to implement double-ended queue. \
Method: arrays and linked lists. Week 2 assignment of Algorithms, Part I, by Robert Sedgewick in Princeton University.\
Score 100/100.\
A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure.\
Permutation output: reads a sequence of strings from standard input using StdIn.readString(); and prints exactly k of them, uniformly at random. Print each item from the sequence at most once.\
